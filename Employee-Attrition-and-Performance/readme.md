## Exercise
Uncover the factors that lead to employee attrition and explore important questions such as ‘show me a breakdown of distance from home by job role and attrition’ or ‘compare average monthly income by education and attrition’.

Implement different data-preprocessing techniques, feature extraction techniques and machine learning models. This is a supervised classification problem.

A few example solutions:
1) Logistic Regression
2) Random Forest Classifier
3) SVM Classifier
4) Decision Tree
5) K-Means
6) Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, CatBoost)
7) Neural networks 
8) Other

## Dataset

Data path: `../data/employee_attrition.csv`

Data source: [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)


## Suggestions/guides:

We will have a model performance comparison table, so it is best to standardise metric/measures as well as some performance measurement practices. 

- Please use train/test split ratio of 80/20. Random seeds could be anything, they should not matter.

- Please provide the full confusion marix and F1 score.

- If you are referring the project from somewhere, make sure you do some changes on your own. Do not copy paste and submit.

- The codes must have comments to explain them.
